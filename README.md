Hi!

The Html file is a ready to view version of the code so I'd recommend opening that. 

If you'd like, I also attached the rmd file, which can be opened in Rstudio.

The thing I'd like to draw focus to is the graphs, I can create those for any purpose, 
such as analyzing product sales trends relatively easily depending on the data set Amazon provides and if that includes dates/months of sale.
