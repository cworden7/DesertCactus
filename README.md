Hi!

If you'd like to view these files, follow these steps:

1. Download the files by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button and then click "Download Zip".
2. Choose file to open: The DesertCactusSample.html is a ready to view version of the work and shows complete graphs. It opens right in your browser and I'd recommend opening this file. The DesertCactusSample.rmd is an Rmarkdown document and can be opened in Rstudio where you can edit the code and see how the code executes.  

Enjoy!
Colin
