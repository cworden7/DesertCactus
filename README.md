Hi!

If you'd like to view these files, you can either click directly on them or download the files by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button and then click "Download Zip".

Class-project-sample-college_majors&outcomes.pdf is a data analysis I did for class. I saved it as a pdf for easy viewing and security, but ordinarily, you can interact with the tables. The graphs are perhaps the most important part of this file, and those are located near the end of the pdf. I used the "recentgrads.csv" dataset to do this project.

Desert-Cactus-Sample.pdf is a random project I created trying to show how I can graph the sales of products over time to help identify trends. I made up the data I used for this and kept it pretty simple, but depending on what data Amazon provides to you in Excel, I could do something like this and perhaps more depending on what you'd like. I used the "datasample.csv" dataset to do this project.

Opening the csv files should open them in Excel and will show you the data used in each data set, if you'd like to check that out.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
